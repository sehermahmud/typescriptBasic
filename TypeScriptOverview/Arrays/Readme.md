Typed Arrays

What is Type Arrays in TypeScript?

Answer:

An array is a special type of data type which can store multiple values of different data types sequentially using a special syntax. TypeScript supports arrays, similar to JavaScript.

For short

Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value

Why do we care?

1. TS can do type inference when extracting values from an array

2. TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array

3. We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions

4. Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types

Where and When to use typed arrays?

Answer:

Now this might seem like a silly lecture to put in here like I'm sure you've got a good idea of when to use arrays but it turns out that there is another very similar data structure in typescript very similar to arrays called tuples or troubles. So we're going to talk about topples in just a second and they're going to look very similar to arrays but with some distinct little differences about them. So for right now I just want you understand that we're going to continue to use arrays anytime we want to represent a collection of different records.

short Answer:

Any time we need to represent a collection of records with some arbitrary sort order
