TypeScript - Type Annotations

What is Annotation?

Answer:

(For understanding the answers had been tried to be given in a understandable way, So I provide the answer in different ways for understanding)

1. Answer: TypeScript includes all the primitive types of JavaScript- number, string and boolean. ... For example, if you assign a string to a variable age or a number to name in the above example, then it will give an error. Type annotations are used to enforce type checking.

2. Answer: However, in TypeScript, we can specify the type of variables, function parameters, and object properties because TypeScript is a typed language. Type Annotations are annotations which can be placed anywhere when we use a type. The use of Type annotation is not mandatory in TypeScript.
